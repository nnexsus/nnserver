            <p style={{color: 'var(--accentTheme)'}}>nnexsus-server (or nn-server) will not carry nor distribute any type of illegal content, valid to the United States, per Illinois resident law. 
                All content is uploaded directly to my (nnexsus) servers, and so, as result, anything uploaded to it I hold the rights to monitor. If content is found to be
                in violation of any of the stated above law systems, or if I or any other moderator finds it to be in-reach of such, it will be promptely deleted, especially if made public.
                nnserver and its admins also have right to give information in regards to severe events to the appropriate authorities at any time. Your personal protected information will not be given away (passwords, payments, etc.).  
                nnserver does not condone nor support any of this type of content being held or distributed, and will act accordingly.

                Continuing, shared or public files can be delisted from public view in event of violation or reports. If a large amount of reports from a user surface, the account
                as well can be removed from public view or deleted, though, you will be given a termination date to verise your files in. Banning from the site will remain active until the given period
                in a ban note. In speculation of a ban evasion, nnserver admins can temporarily suspend accounts for investigation. If ban evasion is found to be present, the account will be deleted without notice,
                and credentials blacklisted from the site.

                Regarding hacking, breaching, or server manipulation. nnserver connects to Arina-Server, the actual main network backend to fuel nnserver and all my other projects.
                High violation, maipulation, abuse, or any other aggressive or malicious directed towards Arina-Server, especially from nnserver, can result is permenant information and IP blacklisting from
                all Arina-Server products, including nnserver, at any point in time.

                End of Terms of Service.

                I'd like to proceed the ToS with a more personalized version of the ToS:
                    If I ever hear reports of anything on my server that I seriously do not like, or is just straight up illegal, I'm gonna delete it dude.
                    I do not want legal trouble, obviously (who would?), but I am willing to press charges and give information away for anyone who does upload that crap to 
                    anything I run through Arina-Server, mostly because I do not want repeat offenders, but also because I probably don't like you as a person.

                    Strong exception if I find it funny, though.
